# Hi github user growy! This is a message for you :) 

It's a bit wierd, I know.. but it's because there are no private messages here on github.

I'm starting an open source project with the name *growy*. Seeing that you don't have any public activity on your account, I was hoping you migt be willing to accept an offer for the account so that we could create an organization with the same name. Or, if you feel very generous, perhaps even consider donating the account to the open source project? We are building an awesome tool for gardening and growing veggies!

Please, get in touch with me at anders@4zm.org

All the best,
Anders
